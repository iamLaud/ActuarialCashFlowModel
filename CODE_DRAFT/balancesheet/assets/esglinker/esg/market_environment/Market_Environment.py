        Definition: Market Environment
        ==============================
        Market Environment refers to factors and forces that affect the ability to build and maintain a successful operation of an insurance company.

        Objective:
        ==========
        This class provides a general framework of a market environment relevant for asset valuation.

        Attributes:
        ===========

        1. name:
            Type: string
            Function: market environment's name.

        2. vol_rate:
            Type: float (positive only)
            Function: constant volativity of the interest rate

        3. mean_rate:
            Type: float (positive only)
            Function: constant long term mean level of the interest rate (only for the Vasicek model)

        4. speed_rate:
            Type: float (positive only)
            Function: constant speed of reversion.

        5. init_stock:
            Type: float
            Function: normalised initial stock value (e.g. init_stock = 1)

        6. vol_stock:
            Type: float (positive only)
            Function: constant volativity coefficient in the geometric brownian motion model which is commonly used for modeling in finance

        7. dividend_rate:
            Type: float (positive only)
            Function: dividend return rate

        8. coupon_rate:
            Type: float (positive only)
            Function: coupon interest rate

        9. nominal: (This attribute will be deleted in the next version)
            Type: float (positive only)
            Function: bond's nominal value or face value

        10. bond_maturity: (This attribute will be deleted in the next version)
            Type: int
            Function: bond's maturity.

        11. curve: (This attribute will be deleted in the next version)
            Type: list/array-like
            Function: current zero-coupon curve if it is given

        12. time_range:
            Type: list/array-like
            Function: time range of the current zero-coupon curve

        13. maturity_range:
            Type: list/array-like
            Function: time range of the current forward yield curve

        14. forward_rate:
            Type: list/array-like
            Function: current forward yield curve
